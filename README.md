## concept of the project
Ill start with a little background on this project .This is my final semester mechanical engineering project.Being a mechanical engineer, i wanted to do something related to programming and machine vision seemed to the technology which connected both the worlds. The project is based on the concept of machine vision i.e using computer vision to identify and measure objects. In mechanical engineering , this project comes under the metrology domain which is concerned with measuring objects. The objective of the project is to provide an alternative to  manual quality control process which involves measuring objects one by one using required instruments which in general is very time consuming and more prone to errors. Implementing this technology would reduce the time and errors significantly and thereby increase the production.
